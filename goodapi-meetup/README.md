# DevOps and APIs
## Details
Making sure you're delivering the right API is essential for the success of your internal or external digital product. It can be easy in the beginning when you're just about to release the first API, but this process gets insanely complex and expensive when the number of APIs, requirements, teams, versions, clients, consumers, and deployment environments grows. It gets almost impossible outside of the boundary of your organization.

Adam Kliment and Zdenek Nemec from Good API will present the key concepts and tools for collaborative API Design and contract-driven development, how to validate the API Design automatically against the implementation and how to keep delivering the API Servers and Clients through the Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline at the highest pace possible without breaking nothing.
